  # SLXSAND refers to the proportion of sand present in the soil. The rest is filled with clay. So a SLXSAND
  # value of 0.38 means that the soil is 38% sand and 62% clay. 
  # SM_FIRE refers to the flammability of the ecosystem. Higher SM_FIRE values (up to 0.04) mean that the
  # ecosystem is more flammable. Lower values (down to 0.00) mean that the ecosystem is less flammable.
  # RUNID refers to the identity of the run. 
  # nfire refers to the total number of times the ecosystem caught fire between 1800 and 2014. 
  # nfire.1 refers to how many times the ecosytem caught fire in the first 100 years of the simulation (1800- 1899)
  # nfire.L refers to the number of times the ecosystem caught fire in the last 100 years of the simulation (1915-2014)
  # nfire.diff is the change in fire occurrence (number of times the ecosystem caught fire) between the 
  # first and last 100 years of the simulation. 
  # nfire.pdiff is the proportional change in fire occurrence between the first and last 100 years of the simulation. 
  # sm.1 refers to the average soil moisture over the first 25 years of the simulation. 
  # sm.L refers to the average soil moisture over the last 25 years of the simulation. 
  # sm.diff refers to the change in average soil moisture between the first and last 25 years of the simulation. 
  # agb_1 refers to the average aboveground biomass over the first 25 years of the simulation. 
  # agb_L refers to the average aboveground biomass over the last 25 years of the simulation. 
  # diff refers to the absolute change in average aboveground biomass between the first and last 25 years of the simulation. 
  # p.diff refers to the proportional change in average aboveground biomass between the first and last 25 years of the simulation.
